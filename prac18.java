/*Create a class named 'Member' having the following 
members: Data members 
1 - Name 2 - Age 3 - Phone number 4 - Address 5 â€“ Salary 
It also has a method named 'printSalary' which prints the 
salary of the members. Two classes 'Employee' and 
'Manager' inherits the 'Member' class. The 'Employee' and 
'Manager' classes have data members 'specialization' and 
'department' respectively. Now, assign name, age, phone 
number, address and salary to an employee and a manager 
by making an object of both of these classes and print the 
same. */
